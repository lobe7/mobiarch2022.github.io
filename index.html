                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>The program committee is delighted to invite you to the 16th Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture MobiArch 2022. 
					The workshop will be held on the 22nd Oct, 2022. MobiArch is in conjunction with <a
                            href="https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2022/">MobiCom 2022</a></p>
                    <h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
                    <p>The last two decades have witnessed an extremely fast evolution of network technologies and an unprecedented 
                    growth in mobile data traffic. According to Cisco Annual Internet Report, over 70 percent of the global population 
                    will have mobile connectivity by 2023 and machine to machine (M2M) connections will be half of the global connected 
                    devices and connections. This trend is coming along with increased capabilities and intelligence of devices, hence 
                    offering great opportunities for research innovation and development.</p>
                    <p>Globally, 5G network deployment is rapidly moving from trials to early commercialisation and is promising to provide 
                    higher data speeds at low latency and enhanced throughput to handle more simultaneous connections without causing disruptions. 
                    However, some issues and challenges have not been fully addressed in 5G mobile networks and they are attracting further research 
                    efforts like the emerging applications challenges that are pushing the required quality of service to extreme levels, the mobile 
                    edge computing issues for user mobility support in small cells, the tendency towards Open and smart RAN enabling interoperable 
                    interfaces, RAN virtualization that push embedded machine learning systems and artificial intelligence back end modules for an 
                    enhanced RAN intelligence.</p>
                    <p>These challenges drive the need towards deep research on next generation mobile Internet system that would tackle these 
                    challenges while delivering new mobile services and defining the fundamental architectural components for the next generation 
                    mobile Internet.</p>
                    <p><b>The proposed MobiArchâ€™22 workshop will focus on the technical architecture issues for next generation mobile Internet, 
                    to tackle the aforementioned challenges.</b> MobiArch 2022 welcomes submissions from both researchers and practitioners from academia 
                    and industry that explore the latest developments in mobile communication technologies and architectures. In addition, 
                    we encourage work-in-progress and position papers that describe highly original ideas, present new directions, or have 
                    the potential to generate insightful provocative discussion at the workshop.</p>
